## Build process and tests

If you'd like to fix, customize or otherwise improve the project: here are your tools.

### Setup

[npm][] and [Bower][] set up the environment for you. 

- The only thing you've got to have on your machine is [Node.js]. Download the installer [here][Node.js].
- Open a command prompt in the project directory.
- Run `npm install`. (Creates the environment.)
- Run `bower install`. (Fetches the dependencies of the script.)

Your test and build environment is ready now. If you want to test against specific versions of Backbone, edit `bower.json` first.

### Running tests, creating a new build

The test tool chain: [Grunt][] (task runner), [Karma][] (test runner), [Mocha][] (test framework), [Chai][] (assertion library), [Sinon][] (mocking framework). The good news: you don't need to worry about any of this.

A handful of commands manage everything for you:

- Run the tests in a terminal with `grunt test`.
- Run the tests in a browser interactively, live-reloading the page when the source or the tests change: `grunt interactive`.
- Build the dist files (also running tests and linter) with `grunt build`, or just `grunt`.
- Build continuously on every save with `grunt ci`.
- Change the version number throughout the project with `grunt setver --to=1.2.3`. Or just increment the revision with `grunt setver --inc`. (Remember to rebuild the project with `grunt` afterwards.)
- `grunt getver` will quickly tell you which version you are at.

Finally, if need be, you can set up a quick demo page to play with the code. First, edit the files in the `demo` directory. Then display `demo/index.html`, live-reloading your changes to the code or the page, with `grunt demo`. Libraries needed for the demo/playground should go into the Bower dev dependencies, in the project-wide `bower.json`, or else be managed by the dedicated `bower.json` in the demo directory.

_The `grunt interactive` and `grunt demo` commands spin up a web server, opening up the **whole project** to access via http. By default, that access is restricted to localhost. You can relax the restriction in `Gruntfile.js`, but be aware of the security implications._

### Changing the tool chain configuration

In case anything about the test and build process needs to be changed, have a look at the following config files:

- `karma.conf.js` (changes to dependencies, additional test frameworks)
- `Gruntfile.js`  (changes to the whole process)
- `web-mocha/_index.html` (changes to dependencies, additional test frameworks)

New test files in the `spec` directory are picked up automatically, no need to edit the configuration for that.
